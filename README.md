<h1> obstacle-avoding-car </h1>

This is the project prototype of obstacles avoiding car which includes the car control by using Bluetooth connectivity with mobile devices. 

Issues to be fixed:
1) Motor speed is too much, so use 5V battery
2) Some codes has to be fixed.
3) I'm planning to make some codes as header file to make code shorter.
